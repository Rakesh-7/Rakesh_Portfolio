Machine Learning Code Using Python
This project contains various Machine Learning algorithms implemented using python 3.0 compiled on jupyter notebook.

Overview
Each folder containg .ipynb file. Some of the dataset used were imported from library and some are uploaded in the folders as .csv file.

Machine Learning Algorithms:
1) Linear Regression
Project description

E Commerce Data
Worked on E Commerce data to predict Yearly amount spent by Customer on app or on website
Decided which factor affects the amount of money spent by customer, few of the factors are: Avg. Session Length, Time on App, Time on Website & Length of Membership
Data File: Ecommerce Customers.csv
Housing Data
Worked on USA Housing data to predict price of house using various factors such as: Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area House Age, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms & Area Population
Data File: USA_Housing.csv
2) Logistic Regression
Titanic Data
Worked on Titanic data frame to predict survival or non survival of people on titanic
Used mean to fill missing values
Created dummy variables for categorical variables
Data File: titanic_train.csv, titanic_test.csv
Advertising Data
Worked on Advertising data to predict whether customer clicked on advertisement on not based on data available about various features
Data File: advertising.csv
3) Decision Trees & Random Forest
LendingClub.com data
Worked on Lending club data to predict if a borrower pays the money back to investor or not, using decision tree and random forest classifier
Data File: loan_data.csv
Kyphosis Data
Predicted whether a person has Kyphosis or not using decision tree and random forest classifier based on data provided
Data File: kyphosis.csv
4) K Means Clustering
